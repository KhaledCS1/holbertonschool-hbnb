# HBnB Evolution - Part 1: Technical Documentation

## Task 0: High-Level Package Diagram

This document contains the high-level package diagram for the HBnB Evolution application, illustrating the three-layer architecture and communication via the facade pattern.

## Architecture Overview

The HBnB Evolution application follows a three-layer architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Handles API endpoints and services
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Contains core models and business rules
3. **Persistence Layer**: Manages data storage and retrieval

## Package Diagram

The package diagram shows the organization of the application components and their relationships. The facade pattern is used to simplify communication between layers.

### Key Components

#### Presentation Layer
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful routes for all entity management
  - User Management API
  - Place Management API
  - Review Management API
  - Amenity Management API
- **Services**: Handle request processing and response formatting

#### Facade Pattern
- Provides a unified interface for all business operations
- Simplifies interaction between presentation and business logic layers
- Centralizes error handling and validation

#### Business Logic Layer
- **User Model**: Manages user-related operations
- **Place Model**: Handles place management and amenity associations
- **Review Model**: Manages reviews and ratings
- **Amenity Model**: Handles amenity operations

#### Persistence Layer
- **Repositories**: Implement data access patterns for each entity
- **Database**: Stores all application data

## Communication Flow

1. Client requests are received by the Presentation Layer
2. Services process requests and call the Facade Interface
3. Facade delegates operations to appropriate models in Business Logic Layer
4. Models use repositories in Persistence Layer for data operations
5. Responses flow back through the same path

## Benefits of This Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
- **Scalability**: Layers can be scaled independently
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations
